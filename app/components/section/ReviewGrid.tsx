      "GreatFrontEnd has been a great help to me for prepping front end focussed interviews. Lot of focus on JavaScript utility and React/Vanilla implementations. The system design questions asked in interviews are slightly different in front end interviews and GreatFrontEnd really shines here. I will continue to use this amazing platform!",

      "This was the first time I gave full stack/front-end interviews. Coming from Web3, working at front-end for 6 years, I still felt that I had a lot of loopholes in basics of JavaScript, HTML... The questions on GFE cover almost everything that might ever be asked in front-end interviews for companies including startups and FAANG.",
